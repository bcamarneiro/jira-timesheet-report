				<p className={styles.lede}>
					These Terms of Service govern your use of the hosted Hoursmith service
					at hoursmith.io. The open-source code that powers Hoursmith is
					separately governed by the MIT License (Free tier) and the BSL 1.1
					License (Premium tier) in the project repository.
				</p>
				<p className={styles.body}>
					The service is operated by <strong>Future Sketches</strong>,
					established in <strong>Portugal</strong>. By creating an account or
					using the service you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do
					not use the service.
				</p>
			</header>

			<section className={styles.section}>
				<h2 className={styles.heading}>What Hoursmith does</h2>
				<p className={styles.body}>
					Hoursmith is a Jira worklog dashboard. The Free tier is provided as a
					static web application; you bring your own Jira credentials and your
					own CORS proxy. The Premium tier is a paid annual subscription that
					adds a hosted CORS proxy and convenience features.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section className={styles.section}>
				<h2 className={styles.heading}>Your account</h2>
				<p className={styles.body}>
					You must be at least 16 years old to use Hoursmith. You agree to
					provide a valid email address and to keep your account credentials
					confidential. You may delete your account at any time from the{' '}
					<code>/account</code> page.
				</p>
				<p className={styles.body}>
					You are responsible for the Jira credentials you provide to the
					application. Your Jira API token is stored in your browser; we never
					see it. If your Jira workspace is compromised that is not within our
					control.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section className={styles.section}>
				<h2 className={styles.heading}>Subscriptions and billing</h2>
				<p className={styles.body}>
					Premium is sold through <strong>Polar</strong> (Polar Software Inc.),
					which acts as the <strong>Merchant of Record</strong> and seller of
					record for your subscription. Premium is a{' '}
					<strong>fixed-price annual subscription</strong>: the Hosted tier is{' '}
					<strong>€29/year</strong> (with a founding rate of{' '}
					<strong>€19/year</strong> for early subscribers, kept for as long as
					the subscription stays active), and the Lead tier is{' '}
					<strong>€60/year</strong>, rising to <strong>€120/year</strong> as
					further Lead features ship. The subscription renews automatically each
					year at your subscription's price, unless you cancel.
				</p>
				<p className={styles.body}>
					<strong>14-day right of withdrawal (EU):</strong> Under the EU
					Consumer Rights Directive you have 14 days from the date of
					subscription to withdraw and receive a full refund. Email us to
					exercise this right. After 14 days, payments are non-refundable except
					where required by law.
				</p>
				<p className={styles.body}>
					<strong>Cancellation:</strong> You can cancel at any time from the
					Polar customer portal linked from <code>/account</code>. Cancellation
					takes effect at the end of the current billing period; the service
					remains available until then. You will not be charged again.
				</p>
				<p className={styles.body}>
					<strong>Failed payments:</strong> If a renewal payment fails we will
					attempt to charge again over the following days. If the payment
					ultimately fails the subscription will be downgraded to Free and the
					hosted CORS proxy will stop working for your account. Your saved
					configuration (which lives in your browser) is unaffected.
				</p>
				<p className={styles.body}>
					<strong>Taxes:</strong> As Merchant of Record, Polar is the seller of
					record and is responsible for calculating, collecting, and remitting
					VAT for EU customers based on your billing address. If you supply a
					valid VAT ID at checkout the reverse-charge mechanism applies where
					eligible.
				</p>

				<h2 className={styles.heading}>Acceptable use</h2>
				<p className={styles.body}>You agree not to:</p>
				<ul className={styles.bulletList}>

					<li>
						Use the service to send abusive, unlawful, or infringing content.
					</li>
					<li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, scrape, or overload the service.</li>
					<li>Resell or sublicense the hosted service to third parties.</li>
				</ul>

					We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these rules. If we
					suspend your account for cause we will not refund the unused portion
					of your subscription.
