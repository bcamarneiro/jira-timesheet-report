# Rollout Guide

This guide is for the person rolling Jira Timesheet Report out to a team, not the end user opening it for the first time.

The goal is simple:

- get the hosted app in front of people quickly
- make setup predictable
- keep trust high by validating data consistency early
- reduce support load once teammates start using it

## Recommended Rollout Shape

Use a phased rollout instead of dropping the app into a wide team channel without context.

### Phase 1: Internal Maintainer Check

Before inviting teammates:

1. Confirm the hosted app or local build you plan to share is on the latest `main`
2. Run:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run test:run
npm run build
APP_BASE_PATH=/jira-timesheet-report/ npm run build:pages
```

3. Open the app and verify:
   - `Settings` wizard completes cleanly
   - diagnostics show Jira as ready
   - `Dashboard` loads
   - `Reports` weekly and monthly views load
   - read-only snapshots export correctly from `Reports`
4. Run a real-data consistency check for a recent window with:

```bash
node scripts/validate-real-data-consistency.cjs ~/Downloads/jira-timesheet-settings.json
```

For SOCKS5 environments:

```bash
node scripts/validate-real-data-consistency.cjs \
  ~/Downloads/jira-timesheet-settings.json \
  socks5h://127.0.0.1:8080 \
  2
```

The rollout should not start until the current weekly and monthly reporting views agree for a representative recent period.

### Phase 2: Pilot With 1-3 Teammates

Choose a small pilot group first:

- one person who only needs the personal `Dashboard`
- one person who will use `Reports`
- one person likely to hit setup friction such as proxy or permissions

For the pilot:

1. Send the hosted URL
2. Send a teammate-safe `Share Pack` from `Settings`
3. Ask each person to complete onboarding using the guide in `docs/teammate-onboarding.md`
4. Ask for feedback on:
   - setup time
   - diagnostics clarity
   - whether `Dashboard` or `Reports` was easier to understand first
   - any mismatch between expected Jira data and what the app shows

### Phase 3: Wider Team Rollout

After the pilot is stable:

1. Share the hosted URL
2. Share the onboarding guide
3. Provide one default `Share Pack` per team/reporting scope if needed
4. Make clear which path people should take:
   - `Dashboard` for personal weekly close
   - `Reports` for team visibility and compliance
5. Keep one maintainer available for the first week of adoption

## Preflight Checklist

Use this checklist before each meaningful rollout wave:

- Hosted app loads without console-breaking errors
- `Settings` import/export still works
- PWA install prompt still appears on supported browsers
- `Reports` share links reopen the expected filtered state
- `Reports` HTML/Markdown snapshots export correctly
- `Reports` weekly consistency check succeeds for a known-good week
- `allowedUsers` reflects the intended reporting scope
- the local or hosted proxy instructions are still correct

## Recommended Assets To Prepare

Prepare these before sharing broadly:

- hosted app URL
- one `Share Pack` per team or reporting scope
- a short “what is this for?” intro message
- one screenshot of `Dashboard`
- one screenshot of `Reports`
- one known-good recent validation result

If screenshots are not ready yet, the app is still usable, but adoption will be slower.

## What To Share With Teammates

At minimum, share:

1. the hosted URL
2. the onboarding guide
3. a `Share Pack` if teammates should inherit the same Jira host, allowed users, JQL, or calendar mappings
4. proxy guidance if CORS is expected to be a problem in your environment

Do not share:

- API tokens
- full backups unless the backup is strictly for your own restore path

## Support Model During Rollout

Ask teammates to report problems using these categories:

- `Setup`: host, token, proxy, diagnostics, permissions
- `Dashboard`: personal week data, missing worklogs, suggestion confusion
- `Reports`: filtering, weekly/monthly mismatch, snapshots, exports
- `Performance`: slow loads, large month fetches, UI stalls

This keeps triage fast and prevents generic “it does not work” reports.

## Common Rollout Failure Modes

### 1. CORS Or Proxy Problems

Symptoms:

- diagnostics fail early
- Jira calls fail in browser despite valid credentials

Actions:

- verify whether the environment needs the local CORS proxy
- if yes, document the expected proxy URL clearly
- for SOCKS5 environments, use `npm run cors-proxy:socks`

### 2. Reporting Scope Confusion

Symptoms:

- `Dashboard` and `Reports` appear to disagree

Actions:

- check `allowedUsers`
- remember that `Dashboard` is personal and `Reports` can be scoped to a team
- use the in-app weekly consistency validation or the real-data validator before assuming a product bug

### 3. Permissions Issues

Symptoms:

- read works but CRUD actions fail
- diagnostics or API calls return `401`/`403`

Actions:

- re-run diagnostics
- verify Jira token and permission flags in `Settings`

## Rollout Exit Criteria

A rollout can be considered healthy when:

- a new teammate can complete setup without pairing
- the first weekly use succeeds
- the recent weekly/monthly reporting views validate cleanly
- teammates can export at least one useful artifact:
  - weekly summary
  - CSV
  - read-only report snapshot

## Suggested Announcement Template

Use or adapt this:

> We are starting to use Jira Timesheet Report as a lightweight Jira companion for weekly close and reporting.  
> Use `Dashboard` for your own weekly gap review and `Reports` for team/monthly reporting.  
> Start here: `<hosted-url>`  
> If you have a shared setup pack, import it from `Settings`.  
> If setup fails, run diagnostics in `Settings` first and report whether the issue is `Setup`, `Dashboard`, or `Reports`.
